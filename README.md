# Introduction
 Implement a simplified version of Blackjack. If you're not familiar with Blackjack, refer to this video for game rules. Our simplified rules are the following. Please read all the requirements before starting it!

* There will be only two players. One human and one computer (for the Base solution).

* The computer will always be the dealer.

* Each player gets dealt two cards to start.

* The player goes first, and decides if they want to hit (draw a card) or stand (end their turn).

* The dealer has to hit if their hand is below 17.

* Each players' score is the total of their card ranks. Jacks/Queen/Kings are 10. Aces can be 1 or 11.

* The player who is closer to, but not above 21 wins the hand.
